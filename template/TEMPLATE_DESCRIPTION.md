# Manage AI coding sessions from Matrix with YouTrack and GitLab

## Who is this for
Development teams using Claude Code who want a chat-ops interface for
project management. Instead of SSH-ing into a server to run Claude,
your whole team interacts with it through a Matrix chat room — with
issue tracking and CI/CD pipeline visibility built in.

## What it does
- Polls a Matrix room every 30 seconds and routes commands to handlers
- Forwards messages to Claude Code sessions via SSH, posts responses back
- Manages multiple concurrent sessions — start, pause, resume, switch, end
- Updates YouTrack issues directly from chat (change state, post comments, query status)
- Fetches GitLab CI pipeline status and logs, retries failed pipelines
- Reports server load and Claude process status
- Tracks sessions in SQLite with lock-based concurrency and cooldown guards

## How it works
The workflow polls a Matrix room for new messages. A command router
parses `!commands` and dispatches them to the right handler:

- **Regular messages** resume an active Claude Code session and post the response
- **!session** — manage sessions (current, list, done, cancel, pause, resume, switch, log)
- **!issue** — update YouTrack issues (status, info, start, stop, verify, done, close, comment)
- **!pipeline** — fetch GitLab CI pipeline status and logs, retry failed pipelines
- **!system** — report server load and running processes
- **!help** — show command reference

## Requirements
- **Matrix** homeserver with a bot account (E2EE must be disabled —
  n8n cannot decrypt Matrix messages)
- **YouTrack** instance with API token
- **GitLab** instance with API token
- **Linux server** with Claude Code CLI installed, accessible via SSH
- **n8n** self-hosted with SSH private key credentials configured

> This is a self-hosted template. It requires your own infrastructure —
> it will not run on n8n Cloud without a server accessible via SSH.

## How to set up
1. Import the workflow into n8n
2. Edit the **Gateway Config** Set node with your URLs and paths
3. Set `YOUTRACK_TOKEN` and `GITLAB_TOKEN` as environment variables
   on your server (not in the workflow)
4. Create n8n credentials: SSH Private Key and HTTP Header Auth
   (Matrix bot token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`)
5. Create the SQLite database on your server:
```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  issue_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, issue_title TEXT,
  session_id TEXT, started_at TEXT, last_active TEXT,
  message_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0, paused INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  is_current INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
CREATE TABLE queue (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  issue_id TEXT, message TEXT, queued_at TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE session_log (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  issue_id TEXT, issue_title TEXT, session_id TEXT,
  started_at TEXT, ended_at TEXT,
  message_count INTEGER, outcome TEXT
);
```

6. Activate the workflow

## How to customize
- **Add commands** — add a case to the Command Router Switch node
- **Change polling interval** — edit the Schedule Trigger node
- **Swap issue tracker** — replace YouTrack API calls with Jira or Linear
- **Swap chat platform** — replace Matrix HTTP nodes with Slack or Discord
- **Add pipeline detail** — extend Handle Pipeline to fetch individual job logs
